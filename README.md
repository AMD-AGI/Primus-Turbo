# Primus-Turbo
**Primus-Turbo** is a high-performance core library for accelerating large-scale model training, inference, and reinforcement learning on AMD GPUs. Built and optimized for the AMD ROCm platform, it targets the full performance stack in Transformer-based models â€” covering core compute operators (GEMM, Attention, GroupedGEMM), communication primitives, optimizer modules, low-precision (FP8), and compute-communication overlap kernels.

Primus-Turbo is designed to unlock the full potential of AMD GPUs for large-model workloads, providing a comprehensive acceleration foundation for next-generation AI systems.
