"""Per-call HipKittens kernel configuration.

A :class:`HipKittenConfig` describes everything needed to launch a single
GEMM/grouped-GEMM call: the layout (rcr/rrr/crr), the ``group_m`` grouped
tile-scheduling factor, optionally ``num_xcds`` (BF16) and ``kernel`` (FP8).

The selection function :func:`select_default_config` is a *pure* if/else
dispatcher: zero IO, zero cache, zero JSON parse, zero dict lookup. It
returns a :class:`HipKittenConfig` for **every** aligned `(M, N, K, layout,
dtype)` triple — we never reject a shape here. (Hard alignment / dtype
constraints live in each backend's ``can_handle`` and reject earlier.)

Inspiration & precedent: ``primus_turbo.triton.gemm.gemm_kernel.offline_select_bf16``
uses the same pattern. Its docstring explicitly states the 186 offline-bench
entries are "developer-time analysis material, not a runtime table" — the
runtime path is a few if/else branches that boil the empirical surface
down to general rules. We do the same here, distilling the offline
HipKittens autotune cache files into rules that are general over (M, N, K)
rather than a per-shape lookup.

Rule derivation summary (cross-referenced offline at round 1):
  * BF16 (analysis/bf16_gemm/mi350x/bench_bf16_no_jit_final.json, 48 shapes
    x 3 layouts = 144 cache entries): the autotune-winning ``(group_m,
    num_xcds)`` pair is *very noisy* across shapes - {1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 16,
    24} for ``group_m`` and {2, 4, 8, 16, 32} for ``num_xcds``, with no
    single (gm, xcd) pair winning more than ~17% of cases. The binding
    default ``(gm=4, xcd=8)`` is consistent with that distribution and
    matches HipKittens' published convention. Empirically the kernel
    delivers within ~5% of the autotune-winning pair on most shapes when
    using the default. We therefore pick ``(gm=4, xcd=8)`` unconditionally
    for BF16 in this first cut, and rely on the kernel's own scheduling
    to absorb the remaining variance. Future iterations can refine with
    rules keyed on (tiles_m, tiles_n) bins; the framework already carries
    M/N/K so layering rules on top is mechanical.
  * FP8 (analysis/fp8_gemm/mi350x/.autotune_cache.json, 48 shapes x 3
    layouts): much tighter distribution -- ``group_m`` is 4 in 60% of RCR
    entries and 4 or 8 in ~95%, ``kernel`` is "8" in 46/48 RCR entries
    (the two outliers are for tn>=86 with K==4096, where "4" wins). Rules:
      - default ``(group_m=4, kernel="8")``
      - ``kernel="4"`` when ``layout=="rcr"`` AND ``N//256 >= 86`` AND
        ``K <= 4096`` (covers the M=4096,N=22016,K=4096 and
        M=8192,N=28672,K=4096 outliers).

The functions in this module return ``HipKittenConfig`` objects directly;
backends pass them to :mod:`primus_turbo.pytorch.kernels.hipkitten.dispatch`
``dense_run`` / ``grouped_run_balanced`` for the actual kernel launch.
